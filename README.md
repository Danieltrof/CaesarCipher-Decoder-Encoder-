# CipherProgram.py is a program that lets you Decode or Encode Caesar Cipher based on the ASCII range.
When running the program, a Gui will pop up on your screen. Insert the text you want to encode/decode and chose the amount you want to shift it. The result will be displayed in the box below

# Feel free to use the CrackMonoAlphabetic.py to decrypt any Mono-Alphabetic substitution cipher within the English alphabet. 
pip install nltk
Choose enter or file when running the script. Provide the script with the encrypted string or file. The script gives you only decrypted shifts that contain English words. 
## NOTICE
This script has flaws. E.g. It cant decrypt other keyboard languages. If the encrypted message doesnt contain spaces between words, the script will not work as intended.
